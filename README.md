# leishmaniosis
Detecting gender and types of flebotomus for leishmaniosis disease diagnosis

Work in collaboration with:

Prof. Dr. Victoriano Díaz Sáez and M. Sc. Patricia Gijón

University of Granada, Department of Parasitology


The aim of this project is to help diagnose and therefore, speed treatment, in countries with low access to healthcare and high prevalence for disease transmitting mosquitoes.

This is just the beginning of the data collection, and the aim is to help learning to diagnose transmitting from non transmitting (and female from male) mosquitoes from how professional Parasitologies work.

## Questions to address:

-Can we automate/assist the diagnosis for faster treatments?

-Can we do it mobile?

-Can we build a database large enough for deep learning automatic diagnosis based only on images?
